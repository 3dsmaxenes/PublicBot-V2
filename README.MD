Welcome to the Public Version of Elara.
===========================================

Getting started.
1. Go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/ sign in and create a bot user account, grab the bot token then put it in config.js 
(Note: If you are going to host this bot on a hosting site do not add your bots token to config.js [DO NOT SHARE YOUR BOT TOKEN WITH ANYONE!])
2. Go to bot.js you will need to add the prefix you want the bot to have and you will need to add your ID in there aswell.. This is for the bot owner commands [Note: Do not add anyone else in there unless you want them to have full access to your bot.]
3. To download all of the required packages do [npm i] in the console and it will install them all.
4. I have labeled everything in bot.js to explain what everything does etc.
5. You will need to get your own api keys for [youtube, twitch, fortnite, giphy] Links here -->
